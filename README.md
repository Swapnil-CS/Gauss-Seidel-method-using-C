# Gauss-Seidel-method-using-C
* ## This is a C code to solve system of linear equations by Gauss-Seidel iterative method.
* ## It is a generalised code that can solve _any user input equation having any number of variables efficiently_ but as per the method the _number of equations should be equal to number of variables_.
